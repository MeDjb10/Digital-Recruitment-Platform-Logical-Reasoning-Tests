# Real-Time Security Alert System

## üö® Overview

This system provides real-time security monitoring and alerting for online test-taking activities. It detects and reports suspicious behavior to psychologists and administrators immediately as it occurs.

## üîß Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Test Component**: Monitors minimal user behavior (primarily tab switching)
- **Security Monitor Dashboard**: Real-time dashboard for psychologists to monitor alerts
- **Alert Service**: Handles WebSocket connections and HTTP requests

### Backend Services
- **Security Alert Service**: Node.js service with WebSocket support (Port 5002)
- **Real-time Broadcasting**: Immediate alert delivery to monitoring staff
- **Alert Storage**: Persistent storage of security events

## üö® Alert Types

### Tab Switching (`TAB_SWITCH`)
- **Trigger**: User switches tabs or loses window focus
- **Severity**: Progressive (LOW ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí CRITICAL)
- **Action**: Warning system with automatic test submission after 10 violations
- **Warnings**: User receives notifications every 3 violations

### Screenshot Attempts (`SCREENSHOT_ATTEMPT`)
- **Trigger**: Print Screen key or screenshot shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+S)
- **Severity**: LOW 
- **Action**: Log attempt only (operation not blocked, minimal impact)

### Developer Tools (`DEVTOOLS_DETECTED`)
- **Trigger**: ~~F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or window size changes~~ **DISABLED - Developer tools are now allowed**
- **Severity**: ~~CRITICAL~~ **N/A - No longer monitored**
- **Action**: ~~Immediate test submission~~ **Allowed for accessibility and debugging**

### Copy/Paste (`COPY_PASTE`)
- **Trigger**: ~~Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+A, or text selection attempts~~ **DISABLED - Copy/paste now allowed**
- **Severity**: ~~MEDIUM to HIGH~~ **N/A - No longer restricted**
- **Action**: ~~Block operation and log violation~~ **Fully permitted**

### Right-Click (`RIGHT_CLICK`)
- **Trigger**: ~~Context menu attempts~~ **DISABLED - Right-click is now fully allowed**
- **Severity**: ~~LOW~~ **N/A - No longer monitored**
- **Action**: **Fully permitted for accessibility and user convenience**

### Navigation Attempts (`NAVIGATION_ATTEMPT`)
- **Trigger**: User tries to leave the page before test completion
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Action**: Warning and logging

### Test Submitted Due to Violation (`TEST_SUBMITTED_VIOLATION`)
- **Trigger**: Automatic test submission due to security violations
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Action**: Force submission and detailed logging

## üìä Real-Time Features

### For Test Takers
- **Progressive Warnings**: Clear, gentle feedback about violations (every 3 tab switches)
- **Security Status Indicator**: Visual indication of security state
- **Full Freedom**: Developer tools, copy/paste, right-click, and text selection are completely allowed
- **High Tolerance**: 10 tab switch warnings before auto-submission (greatly increased from 3)
- **User-Friendly**: Educational notifications instead of intimidating warnings
- **Accessibility**: No restrictions on browser developer tools or context menus

### For Psychologists/Administrators
- **Live Dashboard**: Real-time alert monitoring
- **Alert Categorization**: Severity-based filtering and prioritization
- **Intervention Tools**: Direct intervention capabilities
- **Sound Notifications**: Audio alerts for critical violations
- **Browser Notifications**: Desktop notifications for urgent alerts

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
// Example: Sending a security alert
this.sendRealtimeAlert('TAB_SWITCH', 'User switched tabs', {
  currentWarning: 1,
  totalAllowed: 3,
  timeOnQuestion: 30000
});
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend/security-alert-service
npm install
npm start
```

### Dashboard Access

```typescript
// Example: Monitoring alerts
this.securityAlertService.getSecurityAlerts().subscribe(alert => {
  this.displayAlert(alert);
  this.playAlertSound(alert.severity);
});
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Alert Thresholds
- **Tab Switch Warnings**: 10 (increased from 3 for better user experience)
- **Warning Frequency**: Every 3 tab switches (reduced notification frequency)
- **Alert Retention**: 24 hours
- **WebSocket Heartbeat**: 30 seconds
- **Cleanup Interval**: 1 hour

### Severity Levels
- **LOW**: Most violations (tab switching, screenshot attempts)
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate violations (frequent tab switching near limit)
- **CRITICAL**: Only test auto-submission and final violations

**Note**: Most restrictions have been removed or significantly relaxed. The system now focuses on monitoring rather than prevention.

## üîä Notification Channels

### Immediate Alerts
- **WebSocket**: Real-time dashboard updates
- **Browser Notifications**: Desktop alerts for critical issues
- **Sound Alerts**: Audio notifications by severity level

### Extended Notifications (Planned)
- **Email**: Critical alert summaries
- **SMS**: Emergency notifications
- **Slack/Teams**: Team notifications
- **Mobile Push**: Mobile app alerts

## üìà Monitoring Metrics

### Real-Time Statistics
- **Active Alerts**: Current unacknowledged alerts
- **Alert Distribution**: By severity level
- **Response Times**: Psychologist response metrics
- **Test Integrity**: Security violation rates

- **Candidate Behavior**: Individual security profiles
- **System Performance**: Alert delivery metrics

## üîí Security Features

### Data Protection

- **Accessibility-focused** with unrestricted right-click and text selection
- **Educational rather than punitive** warning system

### What's Still Monitored (Active Alerts)

- **Text Selection**: Completely allowed for accessibility

### Quick Start

1. **Start Backend Service**:
